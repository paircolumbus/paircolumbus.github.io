#Tutoring Resources

Before we begin coding, let's setup your local development environment. Mac users should note that their operating systems come with a system Ruby & Python. Consider the setup below to be optional.

##Setup :(
- Mac Users  
  - [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/download/)  
  - [Install RVM](http://rvm.io/)  
  - [Install Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)
- Windows Users  
  - [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org/)  
  - [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/)  
  - [Install Atom](http://chocolatey.org/packages/atom)  
 
__Note:__ Installing software is dreaded even by seasoned developers, if you have any problems please ask for help.  

##Advanced Setup :( :(
Software engineers routinely have to work with different versions of language in development and testing environments depending on the application. 

__Recommendations:__
- [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) for Ruby management. RVM is no longer preferred.  
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) and [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) are preferred for Python  
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for Javascript/NodeJS

##Next Steps
Once your environment is setup, please [move on to the Challenge Guide](https://github.com/columbustutoringgroup/Welcome/blob/master/ChallengeGuide.md)!

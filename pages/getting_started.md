[Start Here: Learning to program](/resources)

##Machine Setup :frowning:
Before you start working on challenges, let's setup your local development environment. Mac users should note that their operating systems come with a system Ruby & Python. Consider the setup below to be optional.

### Mac Users  
- [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/download/)  
- [Install chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)  
- [Install Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)

### Windows Users  
- [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org/en)  
- [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/)  
- [Install Atom](https://chocolatey.org/packages/atom)  

__Note:__ Installing software is dreaded even by seasoned developers, if you have any problems please ask for help.  

##Advanced Setup :frowning: :frowning:
Software engineers routinely have to work with different versions of language in development and testing environments depending on the application.

###Recommendations
- [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) for Ruby management. RVM is no longer preferred.  
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) and [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) are preferred for Python  
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for JavaScript/NodeJS

##Next Steps
Once your environment is setup, please [move on to the Challenges](/challenges/)!
